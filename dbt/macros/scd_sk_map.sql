{#
  scd_sk_map(snapshot_ref, id_col, mapping_ref)

  Generates the full query body for a dim_*_sk_map model.
  Reads directly from the snapshot (NOT via stg_*) to avoid circular dependencies.

  The resulting table has one row per entity (canonical_id → master_sk).
  It is append-only: master_sk never changes once assigned.

  Args:
    snapshot_ref:  ref() to the snapshot table
    id_col:        The natural key column, e.g. 'id'
    mapping_ref:   Optional ref() to id-mapping table (old_id, new_id columns).
                   Needed only for entities where the backend can reassign source IDs.

  Usage:
    {{ config(materialized='incremental', unique_key='canonical_id') }}
    {{ scd_sk_map(ref('customers_snapshot'), 'id', mapping_ref=ref('stg_customer_id_mapping')) }}
