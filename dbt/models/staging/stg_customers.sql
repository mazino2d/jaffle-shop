-- Staging: customers — all historical versions with surrogate keys.
--
-- sk:          Unique per version (= dbt_scd_id from snapshot).
-- master_sk:   Stable per entity forever — assigned on first appearance,
--              inherited by every subsequent version including after ID migrations.
-- canonical_id: Resolves migrated source IDs back to the original ID so that
--              master_sk grouping remains consistent across backend ID changes.
--
-- Incremental strategy:
--   Full refresh  → master_sk via FIRST_VALUE window function (bootstrap only).
--   Daily runs    → master_sk via O(1) hash join against dim_customer_sk_map.
